# Email-Spam-Classifier
This project involves building a predictive model to automatically detect and filter out spam emails. Using a dataset of labeled emails, the model learns the patterns and keywords that typically distinguish spam from legitimate mail ("ham"). The goal is to achieve high accuracy in classifying new, unseen emails.
